# GraphCycleFinder
Contains 4 pieces of code.

CycleFinder determines whether graph is hamiltonian or eulerian and returns respective cycles, if present.

DigraphCycleFinder does the same for directed graphs.

Degrees gives information about directed graph's verticies, the amount of sinks/sources and whether the graph is a map.

EulerianGraph finds and shows the eulerian cycle in a graph.
